- Before installing Laravel, we have to install Xampp and Composer first

then the next step is:

- Enter Command Prompt -> Win+R, type cmd and ok

- then, go to Command Prompt or terminal to file server directory. 

  The file server location on XAMPP by default is in the xampp/htdocs directory. to go to the htdocs directory, enter this command. :

  ```
  cd \xampp\htdocs

- after being in the htdocs directory, you must make a request to install the laravel file provided in the github repository, the command :

  ```
  composer create-project--prefer-dist laravel/laravel tubes_pi
  ```

  when the command is successfully entered, Composer will carry out the process of retrieving data and installing Laravel into the directory you have specified. Make sure the internet connection is stable so that there are no interruptions during the Laravel data retrieval process.
